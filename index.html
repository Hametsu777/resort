		Welcome to the Antarctica!!! That's right, Antarctica!!! We've discovered their dirty, little secret. A secret that has been hidden from the general public <br> for far too long.
		The cold, hard truth (no pun intented!) is that you've been lied to. That's right, lied to. You've been told that Antarctica is a frozen <br> tundra, a wasteland full
		of penguins, when in fact it is a sunny, blissful paradise that sits around 75 degrees year round. We here at sun in the fun have <br> 
		decided to expand our beach resort to this not very well known paradise. So if
		you're tired of being lied to about the earth being round and vaccine's <br> being good for you and fake science and fake news, (as well as Antarctica being cold...) then come on
		down to our sunny resort in Antarctica!!! For only <br> $999,999,999.99 a night. (Wow, what a bargain!!!) You can enjoy our many amenites as well as the local restaurants, 
		shopping malls, and movie theaters. So <br> stop your Uber Eats, get off of Amazon, put those pirated movies down and help make Antarctica great again!!! We'll see you soon.
